     atom    2 type  1   force =     0.00020850    0.00011964    0.00001397
     atom    3 type  1   force =    -0.00011941   -0.00006586    0.00000040
     atom    4 type  1   force =     0.00015129    0.00008429   -0.00000580

     Total force =     0.001631     Total SCF correction =     0.000430
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values
